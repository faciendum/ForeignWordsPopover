# ForeignWordsPopover
This is a small program that displays foreign word entities with a click on the icon and randomly changes through words.
My focus was on a minimalistic GUI - currently the foreign words are fixed. A connection to online dictionaries, for example sorted by rarity, would be a nice addition.

# Requirements
The App itself is coded in swift3. I've noticed some changes with the #selector assignments, so if you're using an older XCode with Swift2, you may have to change the syntax a bit.

# Upcoming?

- Add your own foreign words
- Address a public database (sorted by rarity, top 1000 e.g.)
- Tag foreign words
