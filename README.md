# ForeignWordsPopover
This is a small macOS menu app which offers the opportunity to "learn" a bunch of german foreign words via. showing them with a description and an example as a popup.

# Features?

Well, i always wanted a 'menu only'-app which displays some randoms foreign words after clicking on its menu icon. Hit next / prev or just open it again for random word.

# Upcoming?

Adding own foreign words would be nice
as well as tag them as a favorite or already learned
